# Map
A Graph of 18 cities in Canada and there shortest Distance using Dijkstra's algorithm.

The run time of the algorithm is O(V^2) itself, however using MinHeap to store vertices the runtime can be
reduced to O(ElogV). 
The program uses and adjacency matric store the weights of each edge connecting two cities. The graph can be found in graph.jpg for
refrence.
